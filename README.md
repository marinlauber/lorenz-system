# lorenz-system

Jupyter Notebook for solving the Lorenz system using an object oriented ODE solver.

## Author: Marin Lauber

## Note: 
You will need the three notebooks in order to run the Lorenz system simulation. The `untilities.ipynb` contains all the important import for the notebooks to run. The `Runge_kutta.ipynb` contains the ODE solver.
